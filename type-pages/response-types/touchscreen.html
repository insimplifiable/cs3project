		<p>Touchscreen rhythm games, as hinted, uses a display screen in which when touched by something or someone, input is received on the point where it was done so. Most touchscreen rhythm games are in the subtype of mobile rhythm games, where a phone or a tablet's touchscreen is used, while some take advantage of the touchscreens of other devices like in game consoles.
		   <br><br>
		   They may range from simple tapping to complex patterns and movements that take advantange of such an input device like tap-holding, flicks and slide-holding, simultaneously if ever needed to follow the song's feel and vibe.</p>
		<h2>Mobile</h2><hr>
		<p>As phones evolved to have touchscreens and tablets began to spring, these games were made and are played in iOS and/or Android, depending on the store/s it is available in. It is the most known and notable subtype.
		   <br><br>
		   All of them are generally played with fingers, but if compatible with stylus, they may be used to make the player hear their own rhythm if they are a bit late or early. Fingernails are an alternative and a more viable option in case it isn't compatible whatsoever.</p>
