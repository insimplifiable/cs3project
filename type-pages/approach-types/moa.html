	    <h1>Main Object Approach (MOA)</h1>
		<section>
			<p>These kinds of games rely on tracking the objects that are supposed to be hit. When visuals are not really emphasize to make the game seem fun, they are easy to understand: objects approaches its corresponding object at a point, and when it reaches there exactly will it be the perfect time to execute the corresponding input for it.
			   <br>
			   Although, there some games that may include a combination of inputs to successfully hit a note, or necessary extra movements to different types of objects introduced in them.

			<h2>Scroll</h2><hr>
			<p>Most games in which the main object approaches something usually form scroll, or a set of linear paths (or lanes), be it vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or maybe even varied, that the main objects follow to the path's end, which is usually represented as the 'line'.
			   <br>
			   In order for players to read well, there is generally a setting where you can set scroll speed, to set the speed of the objects to your liking. There is also a thing where the game decides if the objects should be perfectly hit on the line or in the middle, and so players adjust to hit at different positions.
